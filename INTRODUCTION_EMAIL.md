Dear [Boss's Name],

I'd like to introduce **WNS Vox BOT**, an intelligent knowledge base assistant I've developed to enhance our agent support operations. This application provides instant, accurate answers by searching through our documentation, enabling agents to resolve queries faster and more efficiently.

## Key Features

- **Instant Document Search**: Finds relevant information from PDF, DOCX, and TXT files in milliseconds
- **Natural Language Interface**: Agents can ask questions conversationally and receive coherent, sentence-based responses
- **Document Management**: Easy upload, view, and delete functionality with real-time indexing
- **Interaction Logging**: Tracks all queries and responses for Voice of Customer (VOC) analysis
- **Modern UI**: Professional dark theme with smooth animations for enhanced user experience

## Technical Stack

**Core Libraries & Rationale:**

1. **Streamlit (1.50.0)** - Rapid web application development with Python, enabling quick iterations and deployment without frontend expertise

2. **scikit-learn (1.7.2)** - Industry-standard machine learning library for document similarity:
   - *TF-IDF & Count Vectorizer*: Fast text analysis without requiring external AI/LLM services
   - *Cosine Similarity*: Accurate relevance scoring for search results

3. **PyPDF2 (3.0.1) & python-docx (1.2.0)** - Robust document parsing for PDF and Word files

4. **Pandas (2.3.3)** - Efficient CSV logging for analytics and reporting

**Why No GenAI/LLMs?**
- **Offline Operation**: Works without internet or API dependencies
- **Cost-Effective**: Zero per-query costs, no subscription fees
- **Fast Response**: Sub-second search results with optimized vectorization
- **Data Privacy**: All processing happens locally, no data sent to third parties

## Performance

- **Search Speed**: 10-50x faster than traditional methods through intelligent caching
- **Accuracy**: Configurable similarity thresholds ensure relevant results
- **Scalability**: Handles thousands of documents efficiently with sparse matrix optimization

## Demo Access

The application is currently running at: **http://localhost:8514**  
I'd be happy to provide a live demonstration at your convenience.

This tool can significantly reduce Average Handle Time (AHT) and improve First Contact Resolution (FCR) by giving agents immediate access to accurate information.

Please let me know if you'd like to discuss implementation or have any questions.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
